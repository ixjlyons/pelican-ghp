This is the source for my Github Pages static site (`ixjlyons.github.io`_) 
generated with `Pelican`_.

I may at some point start writing blog articles, but for now, the site is just
a couple pages to exhibit my academic endeavors.

Workflow
--------
I am still learning about Pelican, Github Pages, and the different ways to
manage the source for the site and the site repo. Currently, I manage this repo
for source and have the output folder (generated by running ``pelican content``)
as a submodule pointing to my Github Pages repo. I like the idea of having the 
source and GHP repos decoupled, but it does feel a bit redundant when I commit 
to the this repo and make an identical commit to the GHP repo after generating 
the site. I am aware of other methods for managing things, but this way is 
simple and it works for now.
