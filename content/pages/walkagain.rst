Walk Again was an international effort to demonstrate a brain-controlled
exoskeleton at the 2014 World Cup opening ceremony in Brazil. I worked as
a part of the human-machine interface team and created an LED-based feedback
system to enable robust control during the demonstration.

This was a once-in-a-lifetime experience to work on an incredibly fast-paced
project involving academic and industry teams.

A short video talking about the project as it was happening. I provide a little
explanation of the purpose of the LED feedback system:
