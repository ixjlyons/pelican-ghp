Hello, I'm Kenneth Lyons.

I am a PhD student in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department at UC
Davis. I work in the Robotics, Autonomous Systems, and Controls Laboratory
(RASCAL), where I run my own research studies on prosthetic control and assist
in other human machine interface studies via Android application development
and data analysis. Here is some stuff I'm interested in:

## Research

Since I am a PhD student, this is the first category in the list :). My primary
research interests include electrophysiological signal acquisition and
processing, the combination of human and machine learning, and their use for
the control of computer and machine interfaces. In English: I'm fascinated by
the fact that our bodies produce electrical signals that can be detected,
understood, and in some cases, used to control things.

I'm most familiar with electromyography (EMG), which has to do with the signals
generated by skeletal muscles when they contract. It is probably most commonly
known as a method for controlling powered prostheses.

Upper limb prosthesis control is an interesting field, both because of the
methods used and the potential for breakthroughs. Current state of the art in
arm prosthesis control is mainly relevant to individuals with amputations
distal to ("below") the elbow only. If I had one piece of insight to offer
after extensive reading on the topic, it would be:

> Robotics technology is soon going to be offering prosthetic arms with
> near-human functionality, but the technology for controlling them is far
> behind. It's like having a modern processor but only being able to program it
> in assembly: you can do it, but nobody wants to.

I'm also interested in leveraging EMG signals of face/head/neck muscles for
computer interface control. While prosthesis control via EMG is for amputees,
this kind of research is relevant to individuals with high spinal cord injuries
(head muscles are innervated at the brain stem so they are unaffected by SCI).

Other research areas that I'm interested in and can have a reasonably competent
conversation about:

* motor learning/control
* brain-computer interfaces
* machine learning
* signal processing

I'm interested in many things beyond that tiny list. I keep on top of things by
regularly consuming RSS feeds from journals like Nature, Science, PNAS, and
a bunch more. For that, I have [Feedly](https://feedly.com) to thank (the
Android app is indispensible).


## Running

I run around parks and occasionally the UC Davis arboretum in the mornings. I'd
consider myself a somewhat serious hobbyist runner. At one point, I was running
200+ km per month, but I have scaled back to take more rest days (4 runs per
week now). This makes the whole running lifestyle more enjoyable: less knee
stress, longer runs are more feasible, breaking a PR is much easier when you
aren't still tired from yesterday.

## Linux

I am a Linux enthusiast ([Linux From Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)
is my idea of a fun weekend). I go to [LUGOD](http://www.lugod.org/) meetings
when I can. You can look at my [dotfiles](http://github.com/ixjlyons/dotfiles)
if you want.

Here are some projects I think are cool:

* [qtile](https://github.com/qtile/qtile) : "A small, scriptable tiling window
  manager written in Python."
* [qutebrowser](https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser) : "A
  keyboard-driven, vim-like browser based on PyQt5 and QtWebKit."

## Programming

I speak Python, C/C++, Java, MATLAB/Octave, know just enough Lua to write
scripts in [v-rep](http://www.v-rep.eu/), and I once wrote a simple TCP server
in C#. My first language was C, and I'm grateful for that. Python is now my
main language, and I'm grateful for that too.

I can write Android apps, but I fell behind the standards back around the
release of Ice Cream Sandwich, when Fragments became a thing (technically they
were introduced with Honeycomb, but nobody cares). I still casually keep up
with best practices (Material design, etc.) but haven't actually used any of
them. I definitely need to sit down and make the switch to Android Studio.

One of these days, I'll get around to properly learning Haskell.

## Electronics

Although I'm a mechanical engineer by (undergraduate) training, I love taking
electronic devices apart. This started as an interest in robotics, but quickly
became a more general enthusiasm for microcontrollers and such. I'm mostly
familiar with Atmel's ATmega microcontrollers, but I've also done a little TI's
MSP430 and ARM (though not enough to setup a toolchain on the spot). I can do
a pretty decent job with PCB layout and have had no total failures arrive from
[OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/).

## Other

I enjoy craft beer. North Coast's Old Rasputin is my favorite.

I play guitar and [listen to music](http://www.last.fm/user/Vorsorken).
