Hello, I'm Kenneth Lyons.

I am a PhD student in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department at
UC Davis. I work in the Robotics, Autonomous Systems, and Controls Laboratory
(RASCAL), where I run my own research studies on prosthetic control and 
assist in other human machine interface studies via Android application 
development and data analysis.

My primary research interests include electrophysiological signal acquisition
and processing, the combination of human and machine learning, and their use
for the control of computer and machine interfaces.
