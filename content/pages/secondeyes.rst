SecondEyes is a telepresence mobile robot meant to allow individuals with
severe mobility impairments to virtually view their surroundings.
A WiFi-enabled camera mounted on the robot streams video to a custom Android
application which acts as a noninvasive, hands-free control interface based on
a single electromyographic (EMG) sensor. This was my Capstone senior design
project in mechanical engineering which turned into my first graduate research
project.

The robot was first used in a case study in which a man with a high-level
spinal cord injury controlled the robot remotely and navigated a simple maze.
This was presented at the IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation
Robotics (ICORR) in 2013.
