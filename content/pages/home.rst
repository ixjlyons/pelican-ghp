Hey there, my name's Kenh and I'm an engineer. This site is sort of a stylized

    <h3>Story Time</h3>

I grew up in a small town in a somewhat remote region of coastal northern
California until starting college at UC Davis in 2008. Mechanical engineering
seemed to be a fairly broad "how things work" major, so that suited me pretty
well. I pursued interests in computing and electronics on the side, and I took
enough linguistics courses to end up with a minor. My capstone senior design
project involved building a telepresence robot and a phone app to drive it
around, combining quite a few of my interests. The project was sponsored by a
research lab on campus, and the idea was to eventually replace the touch screen
interface with one driven by electrical signals generated by a muscle behind the
ear, making it possible for people with very limited or no mobility to gain some
independence and presence in the home. I *had* to understand how such an
interface worked and see what it could do, so I stuck around in that lab for my
PhD. My focus was on extracting information from these muscle signals, and
toward the end, I shifted a bit toward trying to understand some of the
properties of the brain controlling them.

I finished my PhD in the end of 2018 and went to work as an embedded systems
developer in inertial sensing at Systron Donner Inertial (now Emcore) for two
years. I currently work at NASA Ames research center in the Systems Analysis
Office, where I get to function something like a jack-of-all-trades type with
emphases on high performance computing, uncertainty quantification, modeling,
and optimization.

Some Projects
=============

AxoPy
-----

    :height: 1.5in
    :alt: AxoPy logo

AxoPy is a Python library aiming to make setting up human-computer interface
experiments as easy as possible. I spent a lot of time during my PhD thinking
about how to implement experiments I wanted to run rather than focusing on the
design of the experiments to begin with. AxoPy is essentially the result of
a couple iterations on trying to create a general framework for setting up
event-driven experiments in a friendly language.

PyGesture
---------

PyGesture is an open source myoelectric gesture recognition suite for
end-to-end prosthesis control experiments, written in Python. It includes data
acquisition, signal processing, classification, graphical user interface, and
communication with real-time simulation software. Predecessor of AxoPy.

Walk Again
----------

   :alt: Photo of the Walk Again LED feedback system

Walk Again was an international effort to demonstrate a brain-controlled
exoskeleton at the 2014 World Cup opening ceremony in Brazil. I worked as
a part of the human-machine interface team and created an LED-based feedback
system to enable robust control during the demonstration.

This was a once-in-a-lifetime experience to work on a fast-paced project
involving academic and industry teams.

MyoSwim

   :height: 1.5in
   :alt: Screenshot of MyoSwim

MyoSwim is libGDX a game I made for demonstrating computer interface control
through surface electromyography at the `World Science Festival`_ in 2015. It
uses the microphone port of a smartphone, tablet, or computer to record
a surface EMG signal, allowing the player to control a fish popping bubbles and
avoiding bigger fish.

It was a lot of fun to make and we had kids of all ages lined up for hours to
play it at the festival.

SecondEyes
----------

.. image:: {static}/images/secondeyes.png
   :height: 1.5in
   :alt: SecondEyes logo

SecondEyes is a telepresence mobile robot meant to allow individuals with
severe mobility impairments to view their surroundings. A WiFi-enabled camera
mounted on the robot streams video to a custom Android application which acts as
a noninvasive, hands-free control interface based on a single EMG sensor. This
was my capstone senior design project in mechanical engineering, and it turned
into my first graduate research project.

The robot was first used in a case study in which a man with a high-level
spinal cord injury controlled the robot remotely and navigated a simple maze.
I presented the results at the IEEE International Conference on Rehabilitation
Robotics (ICORR) in 2013.

Talks
=====

SciPy 2018: Resonance: Learning Mechanical Vibrations Through Computational Thinking
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a talk I gave at SciPy 2018 presenting some work on really rethinking
how to teach mechanical vibrations to undergraduate engineering students.
I gave the talk on behalf of the instructor of the course which I was a TA for.
We wrote a library, set up a JupyterHub, and wrote tons of notebooks for
in-class and homework materials to bring computing to the forefront as an
approach to understanding fundamental concepts of vibratory systems.

SciPy 2017: Automatic Code Generation with SymPy

the tutorial was on using Cython to work with SymPy-generated C code from
Python. The video below begins where I come in and start talking.

Other Interests
===============

Running
-------

Running has been a semi-serious hobby of mine since about 2012. My favorite way
to explore a new place is to just go out and run around. In the last couple
years, my interests have shifted toward trail running, and this has spawned
curiosity about mapping, ecology, and weather.

I've tracked all my running with `Strava`_ for quite a while and sync the data
to `Smashrun`_ as well.

I ran every day between April 8, 2017 and June 20, 2021. I don't really have
a good reason, I guess I `just felt like running`_.

Free (as in freedom) Software
-----------------------------

I've been a Linux enthusiast (`Linux From Scratch
<http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/>`_ is my idea of a fun weekend) since 2008 or
so and I served as ``typescript`` (secretary) for my local LUG (`LUGOD
<http://www.lugod.org/>`_) for a few years before leaving Davis.

My setup generally involves the `i3`_ tiling window manager, the `fish shell`_,
and vim. You can look at some of my `config files
<https://github.com/ixjlyons/dotfiles>`_ if you want.

Electronics
-----------

I'm a mechanical engineer by training, but I've always loved taking electronic
devices apart. When I got started with programming, I pretty much immediately
took an interest in embedded development. The interactions between code and
electrical signals still fascinates me to this day, probably because of the
wonderful variety of bugs you can find in embedded systems.

Like many, I started out with Arduino and then moved on learn more about the
details closer to the metal. Since then, I've had the opportunity to develop on
a variety of processor families and I've even gotten to work with FPGAs a bit.
One of the bigger projects I've worked on involved porting a fairly complex
bootloader and a runtime application to a TI TMS32028335. I learned a *ton* of
neat stuff doing that.

Other
-----

I enjoy craft beer. North Coast's Old Rasputin is my favorite (in the picture
above, I'm about to enjoy a flight at North Coast Brewing Co. in Fort Bragg,
CA).

I've been playing the guitar and dabbling with music production since about
2003. I'm currently making my way through Mick Goodrick's *The Advancing
Guitarist*, which is fantastic.

I've gone through several phases of learning the German language. I still can't
say *Lehrerin* properly...
