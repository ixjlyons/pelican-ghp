Hello, I'm Kenneth Lyons.

I am a PhD student in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department at UC
Davis. I work in the [Robotics, Autonomous Systems, and Controls Laboratory
(RASCAL)](https://research.engineering.ucdavis.edu/rascal/), where I run my own
research studies on prosthesis control and assist in other human machine
interface studies via Android application development and data analysis.
